## How this result was calculated
- Ran the 'Data Validation' phase: Run quality assurance checks and remove invalid/duplicate records.
- Checked the following key numbers to make sure the calculations looked right:
- - Records before validation (input_records): 34,608
- - Records after validation (validated_records): 29,628
- - Duplicate records removed (duplicates_removed): 4,914
- - Invalid records removed (invalid_records): 4,980
- - Percentage of records passing validation (validation_rate): 85.61
- - Records with negative ENERGY_CONSUMPTION_CURRENT (negative_energy_values): 0
- - Records with negative CO2_EMISSIONS_CURRENT (negative_co2_values): 0
- Saved the finished result so later steps in the pipeline can reuse it.
