**What this file contains**
Geocoded properties with heat network tiers

## How this result was calculated
- Ran the 'Spatial Analysis' phase: Geocode properties and classify into heat network tiers based on heat density.
- Checked the following key numbers to make sure the calculations looked right:
- - Properties with spatial classification (properties_geocoded): 29,626
- Saved the finished result so later steps in the pipeline can reuse it.

## Key checks and numbers
- Properties with spatial classification (properties_geocoded): 29,626
