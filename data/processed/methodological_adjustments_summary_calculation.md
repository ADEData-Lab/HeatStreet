Methodological adjustments summary (JSON)

## How this result was calculated
- Ran the 'Methodological Adjustments' phase: Apply evidence-based adjustments (prebound effect, heat pump flow temp, uncertainty).
- Checked the following key numbers to make sure the calculations looked right:
- - Applied: Prebound effect, Flow temperature, Measurement uncertainty (adjustments_applied): 3
- - Records with adjustments (records_adjusted): 29,628
- Saved the finished result so later steps in the pipeline can reuse it.

## Key checks and numbers
- Applied: Prebound effect, Flow temperature, Measurement uncertainty (adjustments_applied): 3
