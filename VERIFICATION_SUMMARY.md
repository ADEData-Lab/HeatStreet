## CRITICAL DISCREPANCIES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. Energy Prices - SIGNIFICANT DEVIATION FROM OFGEM

**Current Implementation:**
| Fuel | Audit Value | Ofgem Q4 2024 | Discrepancy |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Gas | £0.10/kWh | £0.0624/kWh | **+60% higher** |
| Electricity | £0.34/kWh | £0.245/kWh | **+39% higher** |

**Action Required:**
- Update to Ofgem price cap rates (6.24p gas, 24.5p electricity)
- OR document rationale for higher values (e.g., standing charges amortized, fixed tariffs, conservative planning)
- This affects ALL payback calculations

### 2. Gas Carbon Emission Factor - 15% HIGHER THAN DESNZ

**Current Implementation:** 0.210 kgCO₂/kWh
**DESNZ 2024 Official:** 0.18296 kgCO₂e/kWh
**Discrepancy:** +15%

## WARNINGS AND CLARIFICATIONS NEEDED

### Energy Savings Percentages ⚠️

| Measure | Audit Claim | Verified Value | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Loft insulation | 15-25% | Up to 25% heat loss | ✅ Match |
| Cavity wall | 15-25% | Up to 33% (20-25% realistic) | ✅ Match |
| Solid wall | 25-35% | 33-45% heat loss | ✅ Match |
| Double glazing | 10-15% | 5-10% bill reduction | ⚠️ **Optimistic** |
| Combined fabric | 35-45% | 35-50% | ✅ Reasonable |

### Heat Network Viability Thresholds ⚠️

| Parameter | Audit Value | Industry Standard | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Connection distance | 250m | No single authoritative source | ⚠️ Not verified |
| High heat density | 15 GWh/km²/yr | 25 GWh/km² in literature | ⚠️ Lower than literature |
| Linear heat density | 3 MW/km | 4 MWh/m/yr (Scotland standard) | ⚠️ Slightly lower |

**Note:** Scotland's Heat Map uses **4 MWh/m/year** as base viability threshold. Audit's 3 MW/km is more aggressive but potentially defensible for dense urban areas.

### Prebound Effect Interpolated Values ⚠️

| EPC Band | Audit Value | Verified Status |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| D | 18% | ⚠️ Interpolated (not explicitly stated by Few et al.) |
| E | 28% | ⚠️ Interpolated (not explicitly stated by Few et al.) |
| F | 45% | ⚠️ Partial (Few et al. combined F&G = 48%) |

**Note:** Few et al. (2023) provides exact values for C (8%) and combined F&G (48%), but not individual values for D, E. Linear interpolation is reasonable but should be documented as such.

## CORRECTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### Config File Updates Required

**File:** `config/config.yaml`

**Section: Energy Prices (Lines 145-155)**
```yaml
# OPTION 1: Update to Ofgem rates
energy_prices:
  current:
    gas: 0.0624  # Updated from 0.10 to match Ofgem Q4 2024
    electricity: 0.245  # Updated from 0.34 to match Ofgem Q4 2024

# OPTION 2: Keep current values but add documentation
energy_prices:
  current:
    gas: 0.10  # Conservative all-in rate (Ofgem cap: 6.24p + standing charges)
    electricity: 0.34  # Conservative all-in rate (Ofgem cap: 24.5p + standing charges)
```

**Section: Carbon Factors (Lines 157-167)**
```yaml
carbon_factors:
  current:
    gas: 0.183  # Updated from 0.210 to match DESNZ 2024 (0.18296 kgCO₂e/kWh)
    electricity: 0.225  # Matches DESNZ 2024 grid factor (gross CV basis)

    electricity: 0.050  # Verified - within NESO projection range (0.041-0.067)
```

## DOCUMENTATION ENHANCEMENTS NEEDED

### 1. Add Verification Status to All Tables

Recommend adding a "Verification Status" column to all parameter tables:
- ✅ Verified (exact match or within authoritative range)
- ⚠️ Requires attention (discrepancy or not verified)
- 📝 Assumption (reasonable but no authoritative source)

### 2. Clarify Energy Price Methodology

Add explicit statement on whether prices include:
- Standing charges amortized over average consumption?
- VAT at standard rate (20%) or reduced rate (5%)?
- Direct debit discount?
- Regional variations?

### 3. Update Heat Pump Savings Claims

**Current statement (Section 7.4):**
> "Net energy reduction: 6,667 kWh/year (67%)"

**Recommended revision:**
> "Net **primary** energy reduction varies 30-50% depending on grid electricity primary energy factor. The 67% figure represents the reduction in **delivered** energy (gas eliminated minus electricity added), not primary energy savings."

### 4. Add Uncertainty Ranges

For all cost and savings estimates, present as ranges rather than point values:
- "Loft insulation: £20-40/m² (audit uses £30/m²)"
- "Cavity wall savings: 15-25% (audit uses 20%)"

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Priority 1 (Immediate)
1. ✅ Update gas carbon factor to 0.183 kgCO₂/kWh
2. ✅ Update 2030 grid carbon to 0.100 kgCO₂/kWh (or document conservative approach)
3. ✅ Revise heat pump primary energy savings claim to 30-50%
4. ⚠️ Decision required: Update energy prices to Ofgem rates OR document methodology

### Priority 2 (High)
5. Add verification status badges to all tables in FORMULA_AUDIT.md
6. Add "Sources Verified" section linking to authoritative publications
7. Document that prebound effect D, E bands are interpolated
8. Add uncertainty ranges to all cost estimates

### Priority 3 (Medium)
9. Consider updating heat network viability thresholds to Scotland standard (4 MWh/m/yr)
10. Add notes on regional cost variations (London +15-20%)
11. Document assumptions on energy prices (standing charges, VAT, etc.)
12. Add sensitivity analysis section showing impact of varying key parameters

---

## VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

This verification was conducted by:
1. Cross-referencing all numerical values against official UK government publications
2. Checking academic citations against original sources
3. Comparing cost estimates with multiple industry sources
4. Validating technical parameters against MCS and industry standards
5. Reviewing grid decarbonization projections against National Grid ESO scenarios

**Verification completed:** 2025-12-04
**Next review recommended:** Annually, or when major policy/price changes occur

---

## CONCLUSION

**Overall Assessment:** The Heat Street EPC analysis uses well-sourced assumptions for the majority of parameters (66% fully verified). The main areas requiring attention are:

1. **Energy prices** significantly exceed Ofgem cap rates (critical for payback calculations)
2. **Gas carbon factor** should align with current DESNZ values
3. **Heat pump primary energy claims** should be clarified or revised downward
4. **Grid 2030 projection** is conservative but defensible

The academic adjustment factors (prebound effect, measurement error) are well-cited and accurate. Retrofit costs align well with industry sources, though some values are at the high end of ranges. Heat pump technical parameters are fully verified against MCS standards.

**Recommendation:** Implement Priority 1 corrections, add verification status to documentation, and conduct annual reviews to maintain alignment with official sources.

**END OF VERIFICATION SUMMARY**
# Analytical contract repair verification (2026-07)

The valid pre-change environment baseline was 258 passed and 258 warnings in 30.81 seconds; the earlier 48 setup errors were pytest temporary-directory permission failures. The repaired suite adds semantic contract coverage for a four-property cohort (two HN-ready and two non-ready), spatial join order/count/key preservation, hybrid assignment exclusivity, long finite paybacks, stock-versus-diagnostic publication scope, UTC timing, traceable window economics, and preservation of the previous public snapshot when QA fails.

Known before-state analytical anchors are HP aggregate payback 43.10 years, old truncated property mean 46.66 years, diagnostic hybrid/pure-HP median payback 65.36 years, and readiness mixed/full-ASHP totals £3.762bn/£4.274bn. After-state values must be taken from a successful current-run `qa_checks.json` and run-scoped artifacts; they are not manually inserted into generated outputs.

Validation commands use a workspace-local pytest base temp directory. A development-fixture `--no-publish` run is required before publication; a 168,051-property analytical rerun is attempted when the adjusted cohort and spatial inputs are available. Acquisition is not claimed when raw source data or credentials are unavailable.

Final validation completed on run `20260717T181346828315Z-7cf3a516fdff`: all 8 phases completed, semantic QA passed with 0 critical failures, and the public snapshot was not replaced. The repaired suite result was 267 passed and 256 warnings in 29.23 seconds. On the analytical cohort, HP aggregate/mean/median simple paybacks are 43.10/47.81/41.54 years. The hybrid assigns 48,546 homes to HN and 119,505 to ASHP, with aggregate/mean/median paybacks of 72.85/80.10/73.80 years, so it is no longer identical to pure HP. Canonical full-ASHP readiness investment remains GBP 4.274bn; the separately labelled hybrid-ASHP sensitivity remains the lower-cost sensitivity. Raw acquisition was not rerun because this validation used the available adjusted cohort with a pinned SHA-256 fingerprint.
