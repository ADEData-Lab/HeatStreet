    **Notes:**
    - Gas and electricity prices match Ofgem Q4 2024 GB average capped unit rates for typical domestic dual-fuel direct debit customers
    - Heat network tariff within observed range (c. 0.05–0.10 £/kWh) for UK heat networks; not regulated, treated as scenario input
    
    ### 2030 Projections
    
    | ID | Item | Value | Status | Evidence |
    |----|------|-------|--------|----------|
    | 4 | Gas Price (2030) | 0.07 £/kWh | Scenario-based | [DESNZ Energy & Emissions Projections 2023-2050](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-and-emissions-projections-2023-to-2050) |

    **Notes:**
    - Gas price aligned with DESNZ central fossil fuel price scenarios mapped through to domestic tariffs
    - Electricity price represents reasonable central case given DESNZ and NESO Clean Power 2030 retail price trajectories
    
    ### 2040 Projections
    
    | ID | Item | Value | Status | Evidence |
    |----|------|-------|--------|----------|
    | 6 | Gas Price (2040) | 0.08 £/kWh | Scenario-based | [DESNZ Energy & Emissions Projections 2023-2050](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/energy-and-emissions-projections-2023-to-2050) |

    ### Current Factors
    
    | ID | Item | Value | Status | Evidence |
    |----|------|-------|--------|----------|
    | 8 | Gas Carbon Factor (Current) | 0.183 kgCO2e/kWh | **Validated** | [UK GHG Conversion Factors 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2024), [ITP Energised Grid Factors](https://www.itpenergised.com/new-2024-uk-grid-emissions-factors/) |
    | 9 | Electricity Grid Carbon Factor (Current) | 0.225 kgCO2e/kWh | **Validated** | [UK GHG Conversion Factors 2024](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2024), [HeatStreet Data Sources Validation](HeatStreet_Data_Sources_Validation.md#grid-electricity-co2-factor-2024) |
    
    **Notes:**
    - Gas factor matches 2024 UK Government GHG conversion factor for natural gas (gross CV)
    - Electricity factor matches 2024 DESNZ/UK Government grid factor on a gross CV basis (0.225 kgCO2e/kWh)
    
    ### Projected Factors
    
    | ID | Item | Value | Status | Evidence |
    |----|------|-------|--------|----------|
    | 10 | Gas Carbon Factor (2030 & 2040) | 0.183 kgCO2e/kWh | **Validated** | [UK Government Conversion Factors](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/government-conversion-factors-for-company-reporting) |
    | 11 | Electricity Grid Carbon Factor (2030) | 0.100 kgCO2e/kWh | Scenario-aligned | [Carbon Brief UK Electricity 2024](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uks-electricity-was-cleanest-ever-in-2024/), [Solar Power Portal 2024 Analysis](https://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/analysis-2024-cleanest-ever-year-for-uk-electricity), [NESO Clean Power 2030](https://www.neso.energy/document/346806/download) |
    | 12 | Electricity Grid Carbon Factor (2040) | 0.050 kgCO2e/kWh | Scenario-aligned | [Solar Power Portal](https://www.solarpowerportal.co.uk/analysis-2024-cleanest-ever-year-for-uk-electricity), [DESNZ Energy & Emissions Projections](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/energy-and-emissions-projections) |
    
    **Notes:**
    - Using constant gas combustion factor is consistent with DESNZ conversion factor methodology
    - 2030 electricity factor represents mid-range central-case intensity for a partially decarbonised grid
    - 2040 electricity factor consistent with near-zero-carbon electricity system trajectories

    | 39 | Floor Insulation – Flow Temperature Reduction | 1 K | Heuristic | [Energy Saving Trust - Floor Insulation](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/floor-insulation/) |
    
    **Notes:**
    - Loft insulation: based on roofs accounting for ~25% of losses and partial mitigation from top-up
    - Loft flow temp: small reduction consistent with reduced peak heat loss from roof
    - Cavity wall: walls ~35% of losses; 60–70% reduction in wall losses → ~20–25% total demand reduction
    - Solid wall: at upper end of observed 15–30% gas use reductions in trials
    - Wall flow temp: meaningful U-value improvement supports 5°C flow-temperature reduction
    - Floor: floors ~10–15% of losses; partial mitigation assumed → 5% total demand reduction
    - Floor flow temp: minor effect on peak load relative to walls/roof
    
    ### Glazing Savings

    **Notes:**
    - Double glazing within typical 8–12% savings when replacing single glazing with efficient double
    - Double glazing flow temp: reasonable emitter-side response to lower window U-values
    - Triple glazing: high-case assumption for very poor original glazing; real-world savings in UK climate likely lower
    - Triple glazing flow temp: incremental improvement over double glazing

    **Notes:**
    - Draught proofing consistent with government-estimated bill savings for leaky homes
    - Draught proofing flow temp: small improvement from reduced infiltration
    - Emitter upsizing: emitters change delivery, not demand; 0% reduction is correct
    - Emitter flow temp: consistent with rules of thumb for low-temperature emitter design
    
    ### Combined Savings Formula
    
    | ID | Item | Formula | Status | Evidence |
    |----|-------|---------|--------|----------|
    | 48 | Diminishing Returns Formula | Non-linear savings combination (see code) | Standard modelling practice | [BRE SAP Methodology](https://www.bregroup.com/sap/) |
    
    **Formula:**
    ```python
    remaining_demand = 1.0
    for each measure:
        remaining_demand *= (1 - measure_saving_pct)
    total_saving_pct = 1 - remaining_demand
    ```
    
    **Notes:**
    - Avoids double-counting savings when multiple fabric measures stack
    - Consistent with SAP-style modelling approach
