**Insulation Measures:**\
\- **Loft Insulation (Cold Loft, per m²)** – **£30 per m²** – [Energy Saving Trust – Loft Insulation Guide](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/roof-and-loft-insulation/) – *This unit cost is consistent with EST’s guidance. For example, insulating a 30 m² loft in a semi-detached house costs around £900[*\[12\]*](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/roof-and-loft-insulation/#:~:text=Insulation%20depth%20Installation%20cost%20in,from%200mm)[*\[13\]*](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/roof-and-loft-insulation/#:~:text=%C2%A3900), which equates to roughly £30/m².*\
\- **Loft Insulation Top-Up** – **£1,200 (fixed per house)** – [Energy Saving Trust – Loft Insulation Guide](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/roof-and-loft-insulation/) – *Topping up an existing loft (e.g. from ~100 mm to 270 mm of insulation) typically costs on the order of £750–£900 for a 3-bedroom home[*\[12\]*](https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/advice/roof-and-loft-insulation/#:~:text=Insulation%20depth%20Installation%20cost%20in,from%200mm).

This means the heat pump produces ~3 kWh of heat per 1 kWh of electricity on average. UK field trials have found typical ASHP performance in the 2.7–3.2 range, so* *COP ≈ 3* *is a representative median efficiency[*\[28\]*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/194quit/what_are_peoples_experiences_with_heat_pumps_over/#:~:text=What%20are%20peoples%27%20experiences%20with,efficiency%2C%20whereas%20a)[*\[29\]*](https://raeng.org.uk/media/uk1hb5ms/generating-the-future-uk-energy-systems-fit-for-2050.pdf#:~:text=pumps%20with%20a%20coefficient%20of,3%20will%20also%20effectively%20reduce).*

The analysis considers sensitivity from ~0.2% (current assumption, now recognized as outdated) up to 10% of homes connected. The upper end reflects long-term policy ambitions for expanding district heating in dense urban areas.*
## <a name="financial-parameters"></a>Financial Parameters
