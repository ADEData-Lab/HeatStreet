# HeatStreet Key Assumptions and Calculation Inputs

...

*(The EPC-related inputs ensure the model stays true to certification standards and known errors. The band thresholds are exactly per gov.uk specification【30†L159-L165】 – no issues there. The prebound factors bring in the latest academic findings (Few et al. 2023)【49†L1-L3】, which is very valuable – older models often omitted this. The uncertainty figures from 2019 are the most recent comprehensive study (and still valid); if anything, future research might refine them, but for now they’re appropriate. The only caution is the 0.5 SAP point factor: it’s a simplification. It’s not backed by an official SAP formula source, so we flag it as a **model-specific assumption**. If a more authoritative mapping between kWh and SAP points becomes available (e.g. from BRE), that would be a good replacement. Otherwise, all other values in this section are well-documented and give users high confidence in the model’s reliability and transparency.)*
