# Optional: Geospatial Analysis Dependencies
# These are ONLY needed if you want to use the spatial analysis features (heat network tier mapping)
# The core analysis (archetype, scenarios, modeling) works WITHOUT these packages

# IMPORTANT FOR WINDOWS USERS:
# Installing these on Windows is complex. If you get errors, you have two options:
# 1. Skip spatial analysis - the rest of the toolkit works fine without it
# 2. Use conda to install GDAL: conda install -c conda-forge geopandas

shapely>=2.0.0
